ButtonInsets
============

Demo project for Reactive Cocoa and editing button insets. 

Image, content and title edge insets are fiddly to change, hard to understand and poorly documented. This project is an iPad app to allow easy visual editing of the insets.

Whilst writing it I decided it would be a nice and simple introduction to Reactive Cocoa as well, so I'm working through the various files and RACifying them where appropriate.
